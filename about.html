			<p>Hi, I'm Brian! I'm an aspiring developer.</p>
			<p>Currently, I'm a student at Washington University in St. Louis, where I'm pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I also work for the School of Engineering as a Data Structures and Algorithms. I was born and raised in New York City, and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 2013.</p>
			<p>I love reading books to learn things I'm fascinated by outside of my classes. Currently, I'm reading about Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Security. I like to cook my own food and can make a pretty mean latte. I also like to run, and I usually stay up pretty late because I'm a night person. </p>

			<p>Hi, I'm Brian! I'm an aspiring developer.</p>
			<p>Currently, I'm a student at Washington University in St. Louis, where I'm pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I also work for the School of Engineering as a Data Structures and Algorithms. </p>
			<p>I was born and raised in New York City, and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 2013. In my free time, I read, I cook, I run, I make lattes, and I'm usually up late at night.</p>
			<p>I love reading books to learn things outside of my classes I'm fascinated by. Currently, I'm reading about Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Security.</p>

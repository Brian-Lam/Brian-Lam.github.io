			 <div class="about-text">
			 <p>My name is Brian - I was born and raised in New York City and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 2013. I currently live in Saint Louis where I'm attending Washington University in Saint Louis (Class of 2017), and pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I also work as a Data Structures and Algorithms Tutor for the School of Engineering. I am also probably one of the hardest-working people you will ever meet. </p>

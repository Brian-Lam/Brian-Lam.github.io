					<h3>College Personality Profiler</h3>
					<p>This is data aggregator that creates a personality profile out of a college based off of publicly available data. This was written primarily in PHP during the WUHack 2014 Hackathon. It pulls data from multiple APIs such as Facebook Graph API, Yik Yak posts, and Instagram, and to build data about the "average" person in the area, and presents it in a user-friendly format.</p>

					<h3>inSync Android Bluetooth Music Player</h3>
					<p>This was an Android app I made for my final project for a Software Development course in high school. It sends an MP3 file between two devices over Bluetooth, and then allows the two devices to play and pause music simultaneously.</p>

					<h3>Positive Dashboard</h3>
					<p>This was a short project I did when I got started in web development and chrome extensions. It replaced the New Tab page with a pretty page with a photograph in the background, and encouraged the user to put in a new "positive thought" every day.</p>
